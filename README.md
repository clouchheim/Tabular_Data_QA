# Tabular_Data_QA
Expand upon the “TabuLa: Harnessing Language Models for Tabular Data Synthesis” paper to include integer answers into their QA capabilities

Apply these changes to the SemEval Task 8 Subtask 2 (https://jorses.github.io/semeval/) and use DataBench, created and proposed in this task,
to test the performance of the new adjusted TabuLa model.
