# Tabular_Data_QA
Expand upon the data synthesizing technique in the “TabuLa: Harnessing Language Models for Tabular Data Synthesis” paper 
and apply it to the DataBench QA format. We hope to evaluate the quality of TabuLa data synthesis on Tabular Data QA, evaluated
by the DataBench benchmark

Apply these changes to the SemEval Task 8 Subtask 2 (https://jorses.github.io/semeval/) and use DataBench, created and proposed in this task,
to test the performance of the new adjusted TabuLa model. 

Since paper is unpublished we can verify the results of the paper against the DataBench data sets
