# Tabular_Data_QA
Expand upon the “TabuLa: Harnessing Language Models for Tabular Data Synthesis” paper to include integer answers into their QA capabilities

Apply these changes to the SemEval Task 8 Subtask 2 (https://jorses.github.io/semeval/) and use DataBench, created and proposed in this task,
to test the performance of the new adjusted TabuLa model. 

Since paper is unpublished we can verify the results of the paper against the databench data sets
